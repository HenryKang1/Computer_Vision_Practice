# Computer_vision_lecture_practice
This is computer vision lecture

Hello. My name is Kang.
I am currently doing Ph.D.. I am studying the computer vision and auto damage inspection for study.
I will share small 12 week lecture and how we can learn basic concept and what is important aspect for it.
Thank you for read.
I hope I will share some simple explanation as much as I can.

I also make simple blog to explain my code little bit more.

Utils
1. bitwise.py
I use this file really a lot of time for visualization purpose. I usually handle the binary segmentation problem.
Binary segmentation is the binary mask handling. This might be useful if you need to visualize your work.
2. loss function. ipynb

I strongly recommend this jupyter notebook.
I found it from kaggle competetion and it summarize the good loss functions very well.


Models

I wrote my own model testing.
I test and get some good result I upload.
However I test in the specific vision task not the famous public dataset.
So I do not have pretrain weight for original dataset.

Deeplab v3 plus
Attention UNet
MobileNetV3 Large (this is really good and fast)

Adabins test recently

It was impressive result in the classroom.
Still need to improve the speed of algorithm
