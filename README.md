# Computer_vision_lecture_practice
This is computer vision lecture

Hello. My name is Kang.
I am currently doing Ph.D. I am studying the computer vision and auto damage inspection for study.
I will share small 12 week lecture and how we can learn basic concept and what is important aspect for it.
Thank you for read.
I hope I will share some simple explanation as much as I can.

# Utils
1. bitwise.py
I use this file really a lot of time for visualization purpose. I usually handle the binary segmentation problem.
Binary segmentation is the binary mask handling. This might be useful if you need to visualize your work.

2. loss function. ipynb
I strongly recommend this jupyter notebook.
I found it from kaggle competetion and it summarize the good loss functions very well.

3.remove_small_object.py
You can use this to remove the small particle in the image.

4.dslr.py
Do you want to connect your dslr to computer as webcam?
You can try this.

5.hr_img_processing.py
This code is the how can you test your image for sliding window based classification.
I made this for my colleague's research.


# Models

I wrote my own model.
If I test and get some good result, I will upload.
However I test in the specific vision task not the famous public dataset.
So I do not have pretrain weight for original dataset.

Deeplab v3 plus
Attention UNet
MobileNetV3 Large (this is really good and fast)

# Google colab tutorial

I am recently make some colab tutorial which is made by other people open source code.
I do not have any copyright about this code. Please watch out the copyright about this.
This code is only for playground purpose.
Thank you.
Adabins test recently

It was impressive result in the classroom.
Still need to improve the speed of algorithm
Salient object segmentation
This is remove background in the image. you can try your own filter.
